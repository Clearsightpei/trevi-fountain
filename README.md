# NFT Marketplace

This is the git repo of a project for a hackathon, based on the template from [Full-stack Ethereum Development course][course].

We modify the original template a bit by allowing users to generate a wish card based on AI and it will automatically be turned to an NFT. Periodically the wish card NFT holders can get the opportunities to win the lottery.
